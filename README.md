Vodafone Chatbot is a managerial-level simulation designed to streamline Vodafone database interactions using Large Language Models (LLMs) and LangChain. This project leverages MySQL for data storage and retrieval and utilizes LLMs to generate SQL queries based on user questions. The resulting data is then processed and, if it represents a time series, visualized using graphs to facilitate easy interpretation.

## Download Test Database chinook
First of all, download the [Chinook database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database.git). This is a sample database that represents a digital media store, including tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers. We will use this database to test our chatbot.


## Install MySQL

1) Download MySQL From [Ofiicial site](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
2) Also you cloud download MySQL Workbench From [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)


## Connect chinook Database

1) Go to your terminal and log in to MySQL using the following command:
```bash
$ mysql -u root -p
```

2) You will be prompted to enter your password. Once you are logged in, you can create a new database using the following commands:
```bash
$ CREATE DATABASE chinook;
$ USE chinook;
$ SOURCE chinook.sql;
```


## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later 

### Install Python using MiniConda

2) Create a new environment using the following command:
```bash
$ conda create -n vodafone-chatbot python=3.10
```

Another way to create a new environment is by using the following command:
```bash
$ conda create --name vodafone-chatbot python=3.10
```

3) Activate the environment:
